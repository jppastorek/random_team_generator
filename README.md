# random_team_generator
This is a python 3 program to sort a group of players into two equal (ish) teams.

Ratings go from 2 (worst) to 5 (best). I hope to add a way to import from an excel file so you don't have to add every single player every time. I also would like a way to store the previous teams and possibly an overall average rating.

I also hope to put it all inside of a GUI.

*****There is a sort of bug in that sometimes the teams are unbalanced, i.e. one has 10 players and the other has 8 players.
